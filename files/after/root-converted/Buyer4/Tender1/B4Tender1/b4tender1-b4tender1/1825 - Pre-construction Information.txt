This section should be read in conjunction with Section 4.0 (Inaccessible Areas) and Section 5.0 (Recommendations) as well as Appendix I (Item Number Location Plans) and Appendix II (Building Register and Results). The building register includes a material risk assessment. During the survey the following asbestos containing materials have been identified: N.B. The Recommendations section of this report details any remedial action that will be required to 'manage' or 'make safe' asbestos installations, should any have been identified within this report. N.B. For further sample details, please refer to Appendix II Building Register and Results and Appendix III Certificate of Bulk Fibre Analysis. It should be presumed that the inaccessible areas detailed in Section 4.0 will contain asbestos and be managed accordingly until such time that the areas can be inspected and proven to be asbestos-free. 1.0EXECUTIVE SUMMARY• Main building - External - Bin store - No access was gained to the internal aspects of the bin store  • Main building - External - Garage - No access gained to the internal aspects of the garage  • Main building - External - Main roof - No access gained to the flat area of the roof  • Main building - First floor - Heater cupboard - Grey tiles debris to the floor  J009721   3 of 12 Crewe Cemetery 19/09/2014   Cheshire East Council At the request of Peter Shallcross, acting on behalf of Cheshire East Council (Delamere House), Airborne Environmental Consultants Limited (AEC) have carried out a management asbestos survey of Crewe Cemetery, Badger Avenue, Crewe, Cheshire, CW1 2NA. AEC have been requested to provide the following services: The survey was carried out by Scott Brookes, Rebecca Snowden and site works were completed on the 5th September 2014. This survey report must be read in conjunction with any other associated AEC / or referenced asbestos survey report(s). SURVEY PLAN The exact areas to be surveyed and the survey types requested by the customer to be carried out in these areas are as follows: In addition, several localised areas were identified where the survey team could not obtain full access at the time of survey. These are detailed in Section 4.0. The methodology associated with this survey is given in Appendix V of this report. 2.0INTRODUCTION AND AEC'S BRIEF•To provide an experienced asbestos survey team to site to carry out a management survey, as outlined in HSG 264 Asbestos: The Survey Guide, and our quotation ref: Q010877. •To take representative samples of any materials suspected of containing asbestos and to analyse these in general accordance with HSE document HSG 248 - ‘Asbestos: The analysts’ guide for sampling, analysis and clearance procedures’. •To prepare a detailed written report showing the location, extent and condition of all identified asbestos installations along with any remedial recommendations necessary. All recommendations shall be made considering the building is to be safely managed. Area/building to be surveyedSurvey TypeAreas/installations excluded by customerDetails of scope changed on site by client / tenantA management survey to all internal and external accessible areas of the Crewe Cemetery Lodge.ManagementNoneDuring the survey, the survey team was informed by the tenant that the ground floor flat within the lodge is owned by Wolvern Housing and therefore no longer part of the survey scope.J009721   4 of 12 Crewe Cemetery 19/09/2014   Cheshire East Council A GUIDE TO THE SURVEY RESULTS An item number is used throughout this report to relate a sampled, strongly presumed, or presumed asbestos installation to its location on site. When an asbestos installation is sampled it is given a unique laboratory sample number so that the bulk sample can be traceable within AEC’s UKAS accredited laboratory. In addition to the laboratory sample number the bulk sample is given an item number, which relates the identified asbestos installation to its location on site. Where a material has not been sampled, but is strongly presumed (typically to be the same as a sampled installation) or presumed (typically if not accessible) to contain asbestos, the material is also given an item number, again relating the installation to its location on site. The item number is used on the item number location plans in Appendix I and in the building register and results in Appendix II to help identify where the asbestos installations are located on site. Appendix I and Appendix II must be read in conjunction with the rest of this survey report, especially Section 4.0 Inaccessible areas and project specific restrictions and Section 5.0 Recommendations. The certificate of bulk fibre analysis in Appendix III uses a laboratory sample number to show the result of the analysis carried out on a bulk sample taken on site during the asbestos survey. To relate a laboratory sample number on the certificate of bulk fibre analysis to the building register and results in Appendix II, and thus find the location of the asbestos installation on site, simply look up the laboratory sample number in the building register to obtain its item number or vice versa, if you are reading the building register and results in Appendix II and wish to obtain further details on the analysis carried out on a bulk sample. If you have any concerns about the accuracy of the data, contact AEC in the first instance, as queries may be answered and additional costs prevented. For a full explanation of the various headings used in the building register and results table see Appendix II.  AEC are UKAS accredited for surveying and hold the Type C UKAS inspection no. - 232. J009721   5 of 12 Crewe Cemetery 19/09/2014   Cheshire East Council HSG 264 recommends that, whenever possible, a preliminary desk study be carried out in order to gather information pertinent to the building(s) under investigation. AEC have requested this information and a review of this has revealed the following: Desk study The general NON-ASBESTOS materials used in the structure are described below. Where sampled these will be referred to in the building register and results (see Appendix II). 3.0DESK STUDY AND GENERAL BUILDING INFORMATIONInformation requestedInformation providedBuilding(s) Type/AddressCrewe Cemetery, Badger Avenue, Crewe, CheshireBuilding descriptionMain building - Two storey, detached house converted into apartments - circa - early 1900sUsage of siteCommercialSite conditionsOccupiedDrawings/PlansUpdate existing AEC drawingsInformation on any previous asbestos removal operations at the siteNoneJ009721   6 of 12 Crewe Cemetery 19/09/2014   Cheshire East Council General building information - Main building LocationDescriptionFloorsConcrete to the ground floor overlain with carpet and ceramic tiles, timber to the first floor overlain with a mix of carpet, floor tiles and laminateStairsTimber overlain with carpet, with a lath and plaster underlining, timber panels beneath the banisterSub floorsNone visibleRisers / Service ductsNone visibleWalls externalBrickWalls internalA mix of plasterboard, brick and, lath and plasterCeilings solidLath and plaster, with a textured coating finish within the bathroomCeilings suspendedNoneRainwater goodsPlastic and cast metalWastewater goodsPlasticPlant/EquipmentNone visibleDoors/Window framesTimber doors and frames, a mix of PVC-u and timber sash window framesHeating systemsModern wall mounted electric heaters, copper immersion heater water tankHeating systems - make and model'Creda Redhead' immersion heater, unknown make of electric wall heaterRoof typePyramid hip and flatRoof materialsA mix of clay tiles and bitumen feltInsulation - pipesSectional foamInsulation - boilersMan-made mineral fibre (MMMF) to the water tanks within the loft space,insulating MMMF to the copper immersion heater water tankInsulation - loftMMMF insulationOut buildingsBrick built garage,with a clay tile roof and timber soffit and fascia panels, brick built bin store with a clay tile roof and timber fascia panelsJ009721   7 of 12 Crewe Cemetery 19/09/2014   Cheshire East Council   Other materialsGround floor flat is owned by Wolvern Housing, ceramic toilet cistern, timber panel to the rear of the electric switch boxes, modern sink pad and kitchen unitsJ009721   8 of 12 Crewe Cemetery 19/09/2014   Cheshire East Council During the survey, the following areas were agreed with Peter Shallcross of Cheshire East Council (Delamere House) to be inaccessible for the following reasons: N.B. Any/all inaccessible rooms within the scope of this survey are identified, with item numbers, on the item location plans (if relevant) and listed individually within the building register.   4.4 Client restrictions See Appendix VI for management survey general restrictions and exclusions. AEC have not inspected areas of the property/structure, which are covered, unexposed or inaccessible and we are, therefore, unable to report that any such part of the property/structure is free from asbestos. Although the presence of asbestos in these area(s) is not confirmed, it should be presumed that asbestos could be present and caution should be exercised if any works are carried out there in the future. If any suspect materials are encountered in these areas it is recommended that works cease immediately until such time that the material can be sampled, analysed and confirmed to be asbestos-free. 4.0INACCESSIBLE AREAS AND PROJECT SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS4.1 Agreed inaccessible areas • Behind sampled materials, as these materials may potentially contain asbestos. 4.2 Access limitations • Access was limited within the loft space as no walk/crawl boards were present. • No access gained to external areas above 5m as specialist access equipment would be required.  • No access was gained to the internal areas of the bin store and garage as no keys were available from the cemetery office at the time of the survey. 4.3 Unsafe conditions • Electrical distribution boards/fuse boxes live for survey duration and not accessed. •None. J009721   9 of 12 Crewe Cemetery 19/09/2014   Cheshire East Council Recommendations are based upon the HSG 264 material assessment, and also on a subjective priority risk assessment basis, using the surveyor’s knowledge of the occupation of the property during the survey, and any known future usage or planned works. The implementation of appropriate remedial measures is a requirement under the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 where there is a risk of exposure to asbestos. In view of the findings of the survey, and it is known that on-going maintenance and management of the building is planned, the following recommendations are made:     5.0RECOMMENDATIONS5.1 Items requiring immediate remedial action (as soon as possible and ideally within 3 months). 5.1.1 It is recommended that all grey tiles debris to the floor within the Main building heater cupboard on the first floor be removed. 5.2 Items requiring remedial action in due course (within 6 months).   N/A 5.3Management actions to be implemented as soon as possible but have no immediate risk of exposure.5.3.1It is recommended that all other asbestos-containing materials be inspected periodically, please refer to building register5.3.2If any major disturbance of the fabric of the building(s) is planned it is recommended that all areas that have been subjected to a management survey be further investigated to a refurbishment and demolition survey standard before the works can proceed (see Appendix V for definitions of survey types and their limitations)5.3.3If any areas detailed in Section 4.0 ‘Inaccessible Areas’ are to be accessed or worked upon it is recommended that the areas be subjected to an appropriate survey prior to works commencing. Until that time asbestos should be presumed to be present in these areasN.B. 1.It is a requirement of the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 to use licensed asbestos removal contractors for all significant work with asbestos sprayed coatings, asbestos insulation/lagging, asbestos insulating board (AIB) and any form of asbestos installed in an insulation capacity. This work requires a 14-day notification period to HSE or Local Authority (depending on type of premises) prior to commencement of works. Further to this, it as a requirement of the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 that work involving J009721   10 of 12 Crewe Cemetery 19/09/2014   Cheshire East Council either the deterioration of non-licensed products, or work on ‘degraded’ (i.e. those in a poor condition) non-licensed products be classed as notifiable non-licensed work (NNLW) and the work be notified to HSE. Licensed asbestos removal contractors are not legally required for work with lower risk asbestos products such as asbestos cement, bitumen products, vinyl flooring products, textured coatings etc, or for NNLW work. However, in ALL instances of work with asbestos the requirements of the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 will apply and appropriate assessments, plans of work, controls, PPE/RPE and training will be required. For this reason AEC normally recommend that a licensed asbestos removal contractor be used for ALL asbestos related works as they should have the appropriate training, competence and equipment to undertake these works to an acceptable standard. 2.It is a requirement of Regulation 4 of the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 that all remedial actions be carried out. Following this, the implementation of an asbestos management plan should be carried out, including periodic re-inspection of all identified ACMs on a 6 to 12 monthly basis. 3.In cases of emergency where the uncontrolled release of asbestos is suspected, AEC can offer an independent analytical consultancy service for items such as initial advice, sampling, air monitoring and subsequent management of licensed contractors for any make-safe/removal work that may be found to be necessary (AEC hold a list of nationwide licensed contractors).  AEC contact details are as follows: Airborne Environmental Consultants 23 Wheelforge Way Ashburton Point Trafford Park Manchester M17 1EH Telephone:       0161 872 7111 Fax:                 0161 872 7112J009721   11 of 12 Crewe Cemetery 19/09/2014   Cheshire East Council Regulation 4 of The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 places an explicit duty on persons responsible for buildings (dutyholders) to assess whether asbestos is present and, if so, implement a management plan to safely manage the material. Regulation 4 applies to all nondomestic premises, but includes ‘common areas’ of domestic buildings, such as stairwells, walkways, risers, lift shafts and machinery, tank rooms etc. The asbestos survey of the premises and implementation of the asbestos register goes a long way to compliance with the regulations, including risk assessment of existing asbestos materials, which is covered in the recommendations section (Section 5.0) of this report. However, the management plan shall require a priority risk assessment of asbestos materials to be carried out by the duty holder, and while recommendations in this report are based on the survey team’s subjective priority assessment, using the material assessment, and the location of the materials, the surveyor is not necessarily aware of the future use, occupation, and / or maintenance of each installation. There is, however, a duty under the regulations to carry out ongoing asbestos management works in the future, and the management plan should ensure that the identified asbestos installations remain safe. Airborne Environmental Consultants Ltd. can provide the following further services to ensure compliance with both the recommendations made in this report, and any future duties to be imposed by the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012: AEC have the capability to maintain and to update your asbestos register. This would firstly ensure that asbestos records and procedures are being managed and updated by competent and experienced persons, and also minimise pressure on your management personnel, who would be able to overview the asbestos issue, rather than become involved in the extensive risk assessment and record keeping exercise. AEC can also host and update your asbestos information on our secure web based asbestos management service called ‘asure’. 6.0MANAGEMENT OF ASBESTOS•Regular inspections on the condition of asbestos materials in the premises. This is to ensure that the material remains in a safe condition and is labelled. Also assists in the review of the management plan. •Future management of asbestos. This can include the preparation of priority risk assessments for the management plan, risk assessments for works within the premises, to the preparation of specifications for their removal as required. •Project management of all asbestos removal / treatment works, including competitive tendering of removal works. •Independent analytical services such as air sampling following the removal of asbestos, ensuring compliance with existing legislation. •Liaison with enforcing authorities, such as the Health and Safety Executive or local authority.

This material assessment is a general guide to the risk posed by the asbestos-containing materials, using the product type, damage, surface treatment, and asbestos type to give a risk ‘score’ (for explanations, see below). However, the recommendations in Section 5.0 of this report are not solely a product of this assessment. The survey team, using their experience, observations and current / future usage of the premises gleaned from the customer, give recommendations based on the usage of the area, future activities, and potential for damage. The register table has a blank ‘Remedial Actions & Date’ column, designed for future usage. This column should be used when any removal works, remedial actions, labelling or inspections etc are carried out. It is recommended that regular inspections are undertaken to manage asbestos installations as part of a management plan, and that this information be recorded in the column on the register. HSG 264 states that ‘the person carrying out inspections and assessing the condition of asbestos must be competent and possess enough knowledge about asbestos to make decisions on its continual management’. Should your company or organisation not have a competent person, or the human resources to implement regular inspections, AEC can offer an asbestos project management services to visit premises, and update your asbestos register. Explanation of building register and results table: Item number and sample numbers This report uses ‘item numbers’ to denote materials that have been sampled, strongly presumed, or presumed to contain asbestos. These should be not be confused with ‘sample numbers’, which are unique reference numbers given to each sample taken during the survey to ensure that they are traceable through the survey and laboratory analysis process. The diagrams, tables and photographs (Appendices I, II and IV) all use the item numbers to define any materials that have been assessed (tables also include the sample number for ease of reference). Sample numbers The certificates of analysis (Appendix III) use the sample number as a reference guide. Where a material has been sampled, a unique identification number is allocated to every bulk sample obtained for bulk sample analysis. The unique laboratory sample number ensures traceability within AEC’s UKAS accredited laboratory system. Strongly presumed or presumed Where a material has not been sampled, but is visually similar to a previously sampled material then it shall be cross referenced to the previous sample and noted: ‘strongly presumed (SP) as previous sample’ and allocated an item number. Where a material has not been sampled, perhaps due to its inaccessibility and cannot be referenced to a previous sample taken for analysis, but is either strongly presumed based upon the surveyor’s expert knowledge, or presumed (if there is insufficient evidence to suggest the installation is not asbestos) to contain asbestos, then this material shall be noted as ‘strongly presumed’ (SP) or ‘presumed’ (P) and have “Not Sampled” displayed in the laboratory sample number field on the register. As documented in HSG 264, all inaccessible areas shall be deemed to contain asbestos until can be proven otherwise. Within the limitations of HSG 264, a ‘worst case scenario’ will be given, which is that the area will contain crocidolite. Presumed products known to have never contained crocidolite, e.g. textured coatings, will be presumed to contain their known asbestos type e.g. chrysotile. Presumptions of asbestos type shall also consider the known construction dates of the building, so properties constructed before 1971 will typically be presumed to contain crocidolite. Properties constructed between 1971 and 1985 asbestos grunerite (amosite), and post 1985 building chrysotile only. However, typically, inaccessible areas are likely to contain similar ACMs to those identified within the building. Building register/material assessment Location A description of the exact location of the asbestos installation on site and its location within a certain area. Product or installation Type of material e.g. boarding, floor tiles, insulation etc. Extent Visual estimate of area (m²), volume (m³), or length (linear metres), of installation. Asbestos types Type of asbestos identified in the material. Samples are analysed in AEC’s UKAS accredited laboratory, and certificates of analysis are located in Appendix III of this report. Condition Condition of the installation, from as new, to badly damaged. Surface Treatment This section states whether the material is exposed, painted, or encapsulated. Risk assessment This is gained by adding the ‘scores’ of the previous sections, using the risk algorithm (see table overleaf). Recommendations These are achieved using the risk assessment algorithm, but also known future usage of the premises e.g. if major works are planned. Recommendations are detailed in Section 5.0 of this report. Remedial action & date Column to be used as part of the asbestos management plan. This column should be completed after every inspection, removal, encapsulation, labelling etc. Material Assessment Algorithm The scores from each of the four sections are added together to produce a material risk assessment score: VariableScoreExamplesInstallation / Product type1Vinyl, ‘Bakelite’, Cement2Asbestos insulating board, paper, rope3Pipe insulation, sprayed coating, friable debrisCondition / damage0As new1Slight / minor damage2Moderate damage - breakage to surface treatment3Major damage - smashed or exposed materialSurface treatment0Non-friable e.g. vinyl1Enclosed insulation, encapsulated AIB2Unsealed AIB, encapsulated insulation3Unsealed insulation or sprayed coatingAsbestos type1Chrysotile2Amosite (asbestos grunerite) & other amphiboles3CrocidoliteRisk scoreRisk assessment10 or moreHigh risk7 - 9Medium risk5 - 6Low risk4 or belowVery low riskMethod of Determination to distinguish Asbestos Insulating Board from Asbestos Cement In the Building Register and Results (Appendix II) the terminology ‘Board’ is used to represent Asbestos Insulating Board (AIB), ‘Ceiling Tiles’ is used to represent Asbestos Insulating Board Ceiling Tiles, and ‘Cement’ is used to represent Asbestos Cement (AC). Where the Lead Surveyor during a survey on site is unsure whether a suspect asbestos containing material (ACM) is AIB or AC the terminology ‘Cement / Board’ is used and reported in the Building Register and Results (Appendix II) in the installation column. If there is any doubt about the type of asbestos material after the material has been identified that it is a mixture of asbestos and cement, and reported as ‘Cement / Board’ in the Building Register and Results (Appendix II) it is recommended to have the water absorption test of a sample calculated to determine whether the materials is asbestos cement or AIB. Asbestos cement, in a dry state will absorb less than 30% water by weight, and the method is documented in the ACoP L143. Airborne Environmental Consultants perform this service to UKAS accredited standard ISO 17025, for further details on the water absorption method please contact our Laboratory Manager.   APPENDIX IIICERTIFICATE OF BULK FIBRE ANALYSISSamples analysed by:James ArkwrightCERTIFICATE OF BULK FIBRE ANALYSIS PROJECT REF: J009721 CERT NO.: J009721 CUSTOMER: Cheshire East Council (Delamere House) DATE RECEIVED: 08.09.14 DETAILS: Asset Management Services Delamere House EC Delamere Street Crewe Cheshire CW1 2JZ DATE ANALYSED: 15.09.14 DATE REPORTED: (Verbal) 19.09.14 DATE REPORTED: (Document) 19.09.14 SITE DETAILS: Crewe Cemetery, Badger Avenue, Crewe, Cheshire, CW1 2NA SAMPLED BY: Scott Brookes, Rebecca Snowden   Sample No. Sample Location Sample Description Asbestos Type(s) BA001403 First floor - Bathroom - Grey tiles and bitumen adhesive, beneath the linoleum Grey fragment NAD BA001404 First floor - Bathroom - Blue tiles and bitumen adhesive, beneath the linoleum Blue black fragment NAD BA001405 First floor - Bathroom - Textured coating to the ceiling White fragment NAD BA001406 First floor - Bathroom - Cement debris beneath the bath Grey fragment NAD BA001407 First floor - Bathroom - Loose insulation on the floor and beneath the bath Yellow fragment NAD BA001408 First floor - Heater cupboard - Grey tiles debris to the floor Grey floor tile Chrysotile Comments:     Page 1 of 3  UKAS accredited for identification and site sampling.

Its purpose is to locate, as far as reasonably practicable, the presence and extent of any suspect ACMs in the building which could be damaged or disturbed during normal occupancy, including foreseeable maintenance and installation, and to assess their condition. Management surveys will often involve minor intrusive work and some disturbance. The extent of intrusion will vary between premises and depend on what is reasonably practicable for individual properties, i.e. it will depend on factors such as the type of building, the nature of construction, accessibility etc. A management survey should include an assessment of the condition of the various ACMs and their ability to release fibres into the air if they are disturbed in some way. This ‘material assessment’ will give a good initial guide to the priority for managing ACMs as it will identify the materials that will most readily release airborne fibres if they are disturbed. The survey will usually involve sampling and analysis to confirm the presence or absence of ACMs. However a management survey can also involve presuming the presence or absence of asbestos. A management survey can be completed using a combination of sampling ACMs and presuming ACMs or, indeed, just presuming. Any materials presumed to contain asbestos must also have their condition assessed (i.e. a material assessment). By presuming the presence of asbestos, the need for sampling and analysis can be deferred until a later time (e.g. before any work is carried out). However this approach has implications for the management arrangements. The dutyholder bears potential additional costs of management for some non-ACMs. Any work carried out on ‘presumed’ materials would need to involve appropriate contractors and work methods in compliance with CAR 2012 irrespective of whether the material was actually an ACM or not. Alternatively, before any work starts, sampling and analysis can be undertaken to confirm or refute the presence of asbestos. The results will determine the work methods and contractors to be used. The ‘presumption’ approach has several disadvantages: it is less rigorous, it can lead to constant obstructions and delays before work can start, and it is more difficult to control. ‘Default’ presumptions may also lead to unnecessary removal of non-ACMs and their disposal as asbestos waste. Default presumptions may be suitable in some instances, e.g. ‘small’ or simple premises, as part of a client’s management arrangements. Surveyors should always endeavour to positively identify ACMs. A sufficient number of samples should be taken to confirm the location and extent of ACMs. It is legitimate to reduce sample numbers where materials can be strongly presumed to be ACMs. However the default presumption option should be avoided where possible, as it can make managing asbestos more difficult for the dutyholder. Default presumption should only be used in circumstances where it is requested by the client and/or where access genuinely cannot be obtained. When sampling is carried out as part of a management survey, samples from each type of suspect ACM should be collected and analysed. If the material sampled is found to contain asbestos, other similar materials used in the same way in the building can be strongly presumed to contain asbestos. Less homogeneous materials (e.g. different surfaces/coating, evidence of repair etc) will require a greater number of samples. The sample number should be sufficient to establish whether asbestos is present or not in the particular material. Sampling may take place simultaneously with the survey, or as in the case of some larger surveys, can be carried out later as a separate exercise. All materials sampled and suspected to contain asbestos will not be removed by the survey team to look behind for further suspect materials, as removing asbestos materials may pose a risk to health and breach CAR 2012, such as licensing requirements. All areas should be accessed and inspected as far as is reasonably practicable. Areas should include underfloor coverings, above false ceilings, and inside risers, service ducts, lift shafts etc such as accessing behind fascia and panels and other surfaces or superficial materials. The extent of intrusion will depend on the degree of disturbance that is or will be necessary for foreseeable maintenance and related activities, including the installation of new equipment/cabling. Surveyors should come prepared to access such areas (i.e. with the correct equipment etc). Management surveys are only likely to involve the use of simple tools such as screwdrivers and chisels. Any areas not accessed must be presumed to contain asbestos. The areas not accessed and presumed to contain asbestos must be clearly stated in the survey report and will have to be managed on this basis i.e. maintenance or other disturbance work should not be carried out in these areas until further checks are made. All ACMs should be identified as far as is reasonably practicable. The areas inspected should include: underfloor coverings, above false ceilings (ceiling voids), lofts, inside risers, service ducts and lift shafts, basements, cellars, underground rooms, undercrofts (this list is not exhaustive). Insulation to pipes and boilers shall be inspected on its outer surfaces and at points where the underlying pipe is visible i.e. valves, flanges etc. AEC shall not remove pipe insulation as part of a management survey and shall not remove any surface coverings such as metal cladding or panels that pipes may be behind. AEC shall not normally access high-level roofs other than from safe working platforms or edge protected flat roof areas. AEC cannot therefore accept responsibility for asbestos products located on high roofs, which are not easily visible from safe access points. AEC shall not normally access parts of loft voids that are not immediately visible/accessible from safe walkways and will inspect periodically beneath loft insulation. HSG 264 allows surveyors to presume or strongly presume that visually similar materials are likely to contain or not contain asbestos. In these instances there is the possibility that visually similar rogue items of asbestos containing material may not be identified. During the survey, the survey team will use their judgement to determine whether it is possible to sample materials without causing damage to the structural integrity of the building. Examples of this may be that sampling of the roofing felt may result in a leak in the roof, or breaking an external under-window panel may result in weather penetration. In such instances either no sample will be taken, and a presumption made, or a much smaller than normal sample will be taken. For small samples the accuracy of the analysis will be reduced. In occupied buildings where samples are required, the survey team will use discretion as to the location and size of samples taken. HSG 264 advises that a sample size of approximately 3 to 5 cm² be taken throughout the entire depth of the suspect installation. The survey was carried out in accordance with the HSE document HSG 264 Asbestos: The Survey Guide, and AEC‘s UKAS accreditation as a Type ‘C’ inspection body (number 232). All sample analysis is carried out in AEC‘s UKAS accredited laboratory (testing laboratory 2054). The survey was carried out by an experienced survey team, who inspect all safely accessible parts of the building, and look for any installation that potentially could contain asbestos. Any suspect materials were sampled and subsequently analysed in accordance with HSG 248 - ‘Asbestos: The analysts’ guide for sampling, analysis and clearance procedures’. This method identifies the asbestos types. Samples are taken using low-disturbance techniques, whereby a small amount of material will be taken, after firstly wetting the sample location with a polyvinyl acetate (PVA) solution spray. This minimises the release of asbestos fibres during the process. Air monitoring carried out during sampling work of this type has shown airborne fibre concentrations to stay below the clearance indicator level of 0.01 fibres per millilitre of air. Sampled materials are immediately placed in sealable, airtight sample bags and appropriately labelled. Sample points will be suitably filled / sealed using PVA spray, ‘Polyfilla’ or adhesive tape. Where this is likely to cause distress to occupants or major damage to furnishings or fixtures a reduced sample size shall be taken. Textured coatings are non-homogenous materials, i.e. they do not have an even distribution of asbestos throughout and often only have asbestos present in trace levels. AEC shall endeavour to take representative samples of textured coatings but cannot accept responsibility for localised inconsistencies in terms of sampling or analysis for this material. In buildings where large amounts of items are stored, AEC cannot accept responsibility for any asbestos containing materials hidden/covered by the stored items. The survey shall not include any items contained on the surface of or within the ground beneath or adjacent to the survey area, or items stored inside containers, drawers, cupboards, under false flooring etc within the building/site, unless specifically requested by the customer. AEC cannot accept responsibility for the identification of any sealed void within structures such as bricked up basement rooms, risers etc. or where there is no evidence to support its presence such as clearly marked drawings. Accurate site plans are extremely important in this regard. Management surveys should cover routine and simple maintenance work. However it has to be recognised that where ‘more extensive’ maintenance or repair work is involved, there may not be sufficient information in the management survey and a localised refurbishment survey will be needed. A refurbishment survey will be required for all work which disturbs the fabric of the building in areas where the management survey has not been intrusive. The decision on the need for a refurbishment survey should be made by the dutyholder. Survey restrictions and caveats The value and usefulness of the survey can be seriously undermined where either the client or the surveyor imposes restrictions on the survey scope or on the techniques/method used by the surveyor. Information on the location of all ACMs, as far as reasonably practicable, is crucial to the risk assessment and development of the management plan. Any restrictions placed on the survey scope will reduce the extent to which ACMs are located and identified, incur delays and consequently make managing asbestos more complex, expensive and potentially less effective. In management surveys, surveyors and customers should be properly prepared for accessing all reasonably practicable areas in all parts of the building. Potentially difficult to enter areas (including locked rooms etc) should be identified in the planning stage with the dutyholder and arrangements made for access (e.g. MEWPs for work at height, rooms unlocked, doors/corridors unblocked etc). In situations where there is no entry on the day of the survey, a revisit should be made when access will be possible. Where there are health and safety risks associated with some activities (e.g. height, confined spaces), these should be adequately assessed and arrangements made to control them (see paragraphs 83-91 of HSG 264). Any area not accessed (and where no other information exists) must be presumed to contain asbestos and be managed on that basis. If any restrictions have to be imposed on the scope or extent of the survey, these items must be agreed by both parties and clearly documented. They should be agreed before work starts (e.g. at the preliminary site meeting and walk-through inspection or during discussion) and are likely to form part of the contract. If during the survey, the surveyor is unable to access any location or area for any reason, the dutyholder must be informed as soon as possible and arrangements made for later access. If access is not possible, then the survey report should clearly identify these areas not accessed. Limitations should be kept to an absolute minimum by ensuring that staff are adequately trained, insured and have the appropriate equipment and tools. The surveyors do not disturb any suspected asbestos installation in any other way than to take a representative sample. This measure shall minimise the risk of asbestos fibre release, but shall prevent access above/behind a suspected asbestos installation. It is possible, therefore, that further asbestos materials could be present behind an existing asbestos installation. All relevant sample point data is recorded and shown in the final report e.g. accessibility, condition, extent of material, etc. The pertinent data required to carry out a material risk assessment is recorded and the risk rating for each asbestos installation is given in Appendix II. The material risk assessment is an assessment of the ability of the identified asbestos installations to release fibres into the air. It is not an assessment of the likelihood of damage to the materials identified. The likelihood of damage or disturbance would be determined by carrying out a priority assessment. In order to achieve this, a thorough understanding of the activities on the site is required and therefore this is a responsibility placed on the duty holder as defined in the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012.   APPENDIX VIGENERAL RESTRICTIONSGENERAL RESTRICTIONS AEC have instructed all survey teams that health and safety considerations are paramount during our work. If the survey team find an area where access or sampling will present a risk to themselves or others, they have been given authority to cease works until such time that the risk can be controlled to acceptable levels. This may include accessing confined spaces, work at heights, work near active equipment or processes etc. If such a situation arises, AEC shall inform the customer and explore the possible solutions to the problem. In such instances, AEC will expect the customer to sign to show that the restriction has been agreed. Areas above fixed office equipment, furniture, process equipment etc. will not be accessed where there is a risk to the survey team. These areas will be subject to a visual assessment only. Surveying of fixed items of plant, heaters, services or process equipment shall be restricted to easily accessible external elements only. AEC survey teams are not competent to open/dismantle/reassemble such items and will not compromise any fixed guards etc. In such instances presumptions shall be made on the basis of the surveyors observations and experience. No access was gained to the rear of gas fires in properties, where gas mains are connected. Removal of gas fires could cause damage to the fire and décor, and will cause a fire hazard. ACMs are typically found behind gas fires. Moving plant shall be excluded from the survey unless specifically requested by the customer. In such cases the safety aspects discussed above shall apply. Lift shafts shall only be accessed when accompanied by a competent lift engineer who shall be provided by the customer. In the absence of such a lift engineer, the survey team shall demark the lift shaft as presumed to contain asbestos. Modern man-made mineral fibre (MMMF) insulation to pipework and boiler plant will not typically be removed during management surveys, as this will affect the integrity of the insulation. The survey team, shall always look for evidence of previous removal works and contamination, but will not detect residual contamination beneath new insulation unless this is removed in its entirety. All materials sampled and suspected to contain asbestos will not be removed by the survey team to look behind for further suspect materials, as removing asbestos materials may pose a risk to health and breach CAR 12, such as licensing requirements. Samples have not been taken where the act of sampling would endanger the surveyor or affect the integrity of the material concerned e.g. fuse boxes, gaskets, fire doors, rope seals etc. Samples have not been taken where prohibited by the customer, tenant or their representative, or sampling would cause excessive damage to décor such as tiles, paintwork, carpets or wallpaper. Material referred to as asbestos insulating board and asbestos cement have been defined by visual appearance of the material in situ. HSG 264 allows surveyors to presume or strongly presume that visually similar materials are likely to contain or not contain asbestos. In these instances there is the possibility that visually similar rogue items of asbestos containing material may not be identified. During the survey, the survey team will use their judgement to determine whether it is possible to sample materials without causing damage to the structural integrity of the building. Examples of this may be that sampling of the roofing felt may result in a leak in the roof, or breaking an external under-window panel may result in weather penetration. In such instances either no sample will be taken, and a presumption made, or a much smaller than normal sample will be taken. For small samples the accuracy of the analysis will be reduced. In occupied buildings where samples are required, the survey team will use discretion as to the location and size of samples taken. HSG 264 advises that a sample size of approximately 3 to 5 cm² be taken throughout the entire depth of the suspect installation. Where this is likely to cause distress to occupants, damage to furnishings or fixtures, or cause excessive fibre release a reduced sample size shall be taken. Samples are only taken sympathetically to the décor of the property. This usually results in small sample sizes. The small sample sizes could lead to discrepancies with certain installations, such as textured coatings, or adhesive to the underside of floor tiles, where a larger sample of the material is usually required to confirm the presence of asbestos. Textured coatings are non-homogenous materials, i.e. they do not have an even distribution of asbestos throughout and often only have asbestos present in trace levels. AEC shall endeavour to take representative samples of textured coatings but cannot accept responsibility for localised inconsistencies in terms of sampling or analysis for this material. Where decorative textured coatings appear to have been applied at construction, a single positive asbestos sample among several shall be enough to consider all the materials as asbestos-containing. In buildings where large amounts of items are stored, AEC cannot accept responsibility for any asbestos containing materials hidden/covered by the stored items. The survey shall not include any items contained on the surface of or within the ground beneath or adjacent to the survey area, or items stored inside containers, drawers, cupboards, under false flooring etc. within the building/site. AEC cannot accept responsibility for the identification of any sealed void within structures such as bricked up basement rooms, risers etc. where there is no evidence to support its presence such as clearly marked drawings etc. Please note the information, in part or as a whole contained within this report and all associated liabilities, is not transferable to any third party in any instance. Management surveys are designed to be carried out in occupied buildings where service connections are live. Access during such surveys is therefore restricted to areas that can be easily reached and do not require destructive access. Consequently sealed voids such as partition wall cavities, voids above plaster-boarded ceilings, sealed boxwork/risers etc. will not be accessed. It should be noted that the findings of the survey are discussed across the report in its entirety. Readers should note the contents in all sections of the report and should not rely purely on the information given in individual sections of the report. 4.1Co-ordination of Ongoing DesignAny change in the design during construction must be communicated to the CDM Co-ordinator immediately. Any such change in the design must comply with the requirements of Regulations 7 and 11 of the CDM 2007 Regulations and must be subject to the same Risk Assessment procedures as any other design features.If after the construction stage commences, the design changes, unforeseeable circumstances arise or the Principal Contractor wishes to change the principles on which this Pre-Construction Information was prepared by the CDM Co-ordinator, the Principal Contractor will need to agree any variation with the CDM Co-ordinator to the extent that it affects design.When urgent changes are demanded by circumstances that arise, the Principal Contractor shall attempt to contact the CDM Co-ordinator before proceeding with any changes. However, if emergency action and changes are demanded, the circumstances must be communicated to the CDM Co-ordinator as soon as practicable after the event.4.3Significant or Unusual RisksThe following significant Hazards have been identified and will require the attention of the Principal and other contractors and appropriate control measures will need to be detailed in the Construction Phase Plan. •Asbestos containing materials•Working over occupied ground floorThe above is not exhaustive but the Principal Contractor will be required to address all the Hazards listed and any others which he identifies when preparing his Method Statements to be incorporated in the Construction Phase Plan.4.3Hazardous MaterialsIf any contractor-designed element requires the use of materials which may be hazardous to persons involved in subsequent maintenance, modification or demolition of the structure, a Design Risk Assessment should be carried out. Where appropriate, information in the form of the manufacturers' COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations) Safety Data Sheets must be made available to the CDM Co-ordinator.
